      <h1 className='info'>If you compare how product pages take shape across different companies, it's clear they run the gamut. Some go for the direct approach, displaying an image of a product and explaining why someone should buy it. Other companies create elaborate pages with moving parts and fancy, interactive elements.</h1>
      <h1 className='info'>Still, other companies create delightful product pages that give users an authentic experience as they browse through what the company has to offer.</h1>
      <h1 className='info'>Believe it or not, the most captivating product pages don’t always have enterprise-level programming behind them. To give you an idea of what's possible — from small business all the way up to household names — we scouted out 20 examples that we find truly admirable.

The pages below have mastered their messaging, value propositions, and general product descriptions such that these sites resonate with their unique buyer persona.

(And after checking out these pages, you might want to buy their products, too.)</h1>
<h1 className='info'>Bellroy sells thinner-than-typical wallets. There's value to that — but what is it, and how do you get the consumer to understand it?

To answer those questions, Bellroy divided its product page into three stages of the buyer's journey — understanding the problem, how to fix the problem, and how Bellroy can resolve the problem.

There's even an interactive section that shows how the skinny wallet will fill up in comparison to standard wallets. As users move a slider back and forth along a line, both of the wallets fill up with cards and cash, visually displaying the very problem Bellroy's skinny wallet solves.</h1>
<h1 className='info'>Square is a mobile transaction company that merchants use to collect payment from customers — anywhere, any time, as long as they have a compatible phone or tablet.

The product marketing challenge here is to show why Square is an easier alternative than a typical cash register — and its product page displays those reasons in a visually captivating way.

The rest of the page is clearly organized headlines — which reads like answers to frequently asked questions — plenty of white space, succinct copy, and appropriate images. Anyone looking into each section can understand exactly how Square works at every stage of a transaction.</h1>
<h1 className='info'>Some companies — especially in ecommerce — have up to thousands of product pages. Rent the Runway, an online dress rental company, is one of them.

Rent the Runway has an individual product page for every dress it carries, with all the information a customer could want — images, measurements, fabric, price, and reviews. So what sets them apart? The exceptional detail of the "Stylist Notes" and "Size & Fit" sections.

These details are clearly and carefully curated by stylists and reviewers. They don't just explain what a dress is made of and how it looks — they cover how it fits on every part of the body, which undergarments should be worn with it, and for which body types it's best suited. That kind of information not only delights customers and encourages their trust, but it also makes for a more confident buying decision.</h1>
<h1 className='info'>Daily Harvest develops superfoods in the form of smoothies, soups, and more, and delivers them to your doorstep. What makes these foods' product pages so outstanding? They show you exactly what makes these foods so super in a format that's both clear and digestible — no pun intended.

Check out one of Daily Harvest's smoothie product pages, below. Not only can you see what the smoothie looks like, but hovering over the lefthand preview icon, below the main image, shows you the foods used to create this drink. Scroll down, and you'll see each ingredient and a simple description of each one.</h1>
